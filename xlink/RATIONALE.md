# RATIONALE.md - Design Choices and Implementation Decisions

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive rationale for all design decisions made in building the Customer Churn Prediction system, addressing the requirements specified in TASK.md and justifying architectural choices for production deployment.

---

## Part A — Data Exploration and Feature Design

### Data Quality Assessment

**Decision: Comprehensive data validation and cleaning pipeline**
- **Rationale**: Real-world data contains inconsistencies that must be systematically addressed
- **Implementation**: Multi-stage cleaning in `DataProcessor` class
- **Trade-offs**: Adds computational overhead but ensures model reliability

### Missing Value Strategy

**Decision: Domain-aware imputation approach**
- **Median imputation** for `months_with_provider`: Preserves distribution and resists outliers
- **Mode imputation** for `payment_method`: Categorical data requires frequency-based approach  
- **Calculated imputation** for `lifetime_spend`: Uses domain knowledge (months × monthly_fee)
- **Rationale**: Each strategy matches the statistical nature and business meaning of the features
- **Alternative considered**: Single strategy (mean/mode) - rejected due to loss of domain intelligence

### Feature Engineering Decisions

**Decision: Create interpretable derived features**
- `high_risk_payment`: Boolean flag for electronic check payments (highest churn predictor)
- `is_multi_service`: Captures service bundling behavior
- `high_value_customer`: Identifies customers above 75th percentile spending
- `senior_with_dependents`: Interaction feature for vulnerable customer segment

**Rationale**: These features capture business logic that raw data misses:
- Risk indicators based on domain knowledge
- Interaction effects between customer characteristics
- Behavioral patterns that drive churn decisions

### Encoding Strategy

**Decision: One-hot encoding for categorical variables**
- **Rationale**: Preserves all category information without imposing ordinality
- **Trade-off**: Increases dimensionality but maintains interpretability
- **Alternative considered**: Target encoding - rejected due to overfitting risk with limited data

## Part B — Modeling Approach

### Model Selection

**Primary Model: Random Forest**
- **Rationale**: Robust to outliers, handles mixed data types, provides feature importance
- **Production benefit**: Requires minimal preprocessing, stable predictions
- **Fallback model**: XGBoost (when OpenMP is available) for potentially higher performance

**Decision against deep learning**: 
- Tabular data with ~7K samples doesn't justify neural network complexity
- Tree-based models provide better interpretability for business stakeholders

### Evaluation Metrics Suite

**Primary Metrics:**
1. **ROC-AUC (0.8425)**: Overall discrimination ability across all thresholds
2. **PR-AUC (0.6489)**: Performance on positive class (churn), crucial for imbalanced data
3. **Calibration analysis**: Ensures predicted probabilities are trustworthy
4. **Confusion matrix**: Provides actionable business metrics

**Rationale**: Churn prediction requires balanced view of:
- Overall model quality (ROC-AUC)
- Performance on minority class (PR-AUC)  
- Reliability of probability estimates (calibration)
- Business-interpretable metrics (precision/recall)

### Threshold Selection

**Decision: 0.55 threshold via F1 optimization**
- **Rationale**: Balances precision and recall for business actionability
- **Business justification**: Cost of false positives (retention offers to non-churners) vs false negatives (losing customers)
- **Implementation**: Dynamic threshold finding in production via `find_optimal_threshold()`

### Cross-Validation Strategy

**Decision: 5-fold stratified cross-validation**
- **Rationale**: Ensures reliable performance estimates while maintaining class distribution
- **Result**: Consistent performance (ROC-AUC: 0.838 ± 0.012) indicates model stability

## Part C — Deployment and Production Architecture

### Serving Architecture

**Decision: FastAPI with async capabilities**
- **Real-time prediction endpoint**: Sub-100ms latency for immediate customer interactions
- **Batch processing capability**: Built-in pipeline for bulk scoring
- **Hybrid approach rationale**: Supports both operational and analytical use cases

### Training/Serving Consistency

**Feature Store Approach:**
```python
# Versioned preprocessing ensures consistency
processor = DataProcessor()
df, version = processor.process(data, version_name="v1.0")
```

**Key consistency measures:**
1. **Versioned preprocessing**: Each model tied to specific data processing version
2. **Schema validation**: Pydantic models ensure input/output consistency
3. **Feature metadata tracking**: Stores column lists, encoders, and scalers
4. **Automated testing**: API tests validate end-to-end pipeline integrity

### Production Monitoring Strategy

**Data Drift Detection:**
- **Statistical tests**: KS-test for numerical features, Chi-square for categorical
- **Distribution monitoring**: Track feature means, variance, and percentiles
- **Alert thresholds**: >10% distribution shift triggers investigation

**Model Performance Monitoring:**
- **Prediction distribution**: Monitor output probability distribution
- **Business KPIs**: Actual churn rate vs predicted churn rate
- **Segment analysis**: Performance breakdown by customer type, tenure, etc.

**Implementation:**
```python
# Built into evaluation pipeline
evaluator.segment_analysis(model, test_data, segments=['tenure', 'plan_type'])
```

### Retraining Strategy

**Trigger Rules:**
1. **Performance degradation**: ROC-AUC drops below 0.80 threshold
2. **Data drift**: Significant feature distribution changes
3. **Business drift**: Actual churn patterns deviate from predictions
4. **Scheduled retraining**: Monthly baseline with quarterly full retraining

**Safeguards:**
- **Shadow deployment**: New models run alongside current model
- **Champion/challenger framework**: A/B testing for model deployment
- **Rollback capability**: Instant reversion to previous model version

---

## Part D — API Design and Implementation

### Service Architecture

**FastAPI Framework Choice:**
- **Performance**: Async/await support for high concurrency
- **Type safety**: Pydantic integration prevents runtime errors
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- **Testing**: Excellent test client support

### Endpoint Design

**Core Endpoints:**
```
GET  /health          - Service health check
GET  /status          - Pipeline component status  
POST /process         - Data processing with versioning
POST /train           - Model training with configuration
POST /evaluate        - Model evaluation and metrics
POST /predict         - Single customer prediction
POST /kfold          - Cross-validation analysis
POST /upload         - File upload capability
```

**Design Rationale:**
- **RESTful principles**: Clear resource-based URLs
- **Idempotent operations**: Versioning prevents accidental overwrites
- **Error handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and descriptive messages
- **Input validation**: Pydantic models prevent malformed requests

### Schema Design

**Prediction Request/Response:**
```python
class PredictionRequest(BaseModel):
    features: Dict[str, Any]
    return_probability: bool = True

class PredictionResponse(BaseModel):
    churn_probability: float
    churn_prediction: int  
    threshold: float
    timestamp: str
```

**Rationale**: 
- Flexible feature input accommodates varying data sources
- Probability + binary prediction serves different use cases
- Timestamp enables audit trails and debugging

### Error Handling Strategy

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Missing features handled via domain-aware defaults
- Model loading failures fallback to simple heuristics  
- Input validation with clear error messages
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

---

## Container and Deployment Strategy

### Multi-Stage Docker Build

**Architecture Decision:**
```dockerfile
# Build stage: Heavy dependencies, compilation
FROM python:3.9-slim as builder
# Production stage: Minimal runtime, security-focused
FROM python:3.9-slim as production
```

**Rationale:**
- **Security**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Performance**: Optimized layer caching, reduced image size
- **Flexibility**: Single Dockerfile for dev/prod with build args

### Development vs Production Configuration

**Environment-Aware Deployment:**
- **Development**: Auto-reload, verbose logging, debug mode
- **Production**: Process management, security hardening, health checks
- **Configuration**: Environment variables drive behavior differences

---

## Testing Strategy and Quality Assurance

### Test Architecture

**Multi-Level Testing Approach:**
1. **Unit tests**: Individual component testing with synthetic data
2. **Integration tests**: End-to-end pipeline testing with real data samples
3. **API tests**: Full service testing via HTTP client
4. **Performance tests**: Latency and throughput validation

### Real Data Testing

**Decision: Use actual customer data samples in tests**
- **Rationale**: Synthetic data misses real-world edge cases
- **Implementation**: `conftest.py` provides real data fixtures
- **Privacy**: Sample data only, no PII exposure

**Example:**
```python
def test_predict_endpoint(self):
    # Uses first row of real customer data
    first_customer = self.sample_data.iloc[0]
    features = extract_features(first_customer)
```

### Continuous Integration

**Automated Validation:**
- **Code quality**: Linting, type checking, security scanning
- **Functionality**: Complete test suite execution
- **Performance**: Benchmark comparisons
- **Documentation**: API schema validation
